# Open Space Technology

*"Open Space Technology (OST) is **a method for organizing and running a meeting or multi-day conference**, where participants have been invited in order to focus on a specific, important task or purpose. OST is a participant-driven process whose agenda is created by people attending. At the end of each OST meeting, a document is created summarizing the work of the group. The OST method is based upon work, beginning in the 1980s, by Owen Harrison. It was one of the top ten organization development tools cited between 2004 and 2013."* - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology)
